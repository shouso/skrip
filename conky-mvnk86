3- install the conky_symbols_by_wiltur-d3ij3mi font .

3.1. Go to terminal then write the following(Just use copy and paste):

sudo apt-get install conky-all curl hddtemp lm-sensors python-statgrab

then run those commands on terminal(Just use copy n paste):

$ sudo chmod u+s /usr/sbin/hddtemp

$ sudo sensors-detect

Here in the 2nd command you will get YES/NO.so here you have to choose YES by closing your eyes :p.

4- open rc3 with any editor and go to line 54 "u" is the distribution logo change it to your distro. >> For Ubuntu just change with "o" letter
